# 3DSnake

This was an class exercise during my MSc in Computer Science at Tel Aviv University.

## Basic Design

The 3DSnake game is built using OpenGL. The game is implemented in C++, and it involves controlling a snake that moves around a 3D grid, consuming items to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler and OpenGL installed on your system.
2. **Build the Project**: Use the provided Makefile configuration to compile the project.
3. **Execute the Game**: Run the compiled binary from the terminal.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- The objective is to consume items that appear randomly on the grid to grow the snake.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
